Browser based filters
Browser based content filtering solution is the most lightweight solution to do the content filtering, 
and is implemented via a third party browser extension.


E-mail filters
E-mail filters act on information contained in the mail body, in the mail headers such as sender and subject, 
and e-mail attachments to classify, accept, or reject messages. Bayesian filters, a type of statistical filter, are commonly used. 
Both client and server based filters are available.


Client-side filters
This type of filter is installed as software on each computer where filtering is required.[11][12] This filter can typically be managed, 
disabled or uninstalled by anyone who has administrator-level privileges on the system. 
A DNS-based client-side filter would be to set up a DNS Sinkhole, such as Pi-Hole.


Content-limited (or filtered) ISPs
Content-limited (or filtered) ISPs are Internet service providers that offer access to only a set portion of 
Internet content on an opt-in or a mandatory basis. Anyone who subscribes to this type of service is subject to restrictions. 
The type of filters can be used to implement government,[13] regulatory[14] or parental control over subscribers.


Network-based filtering
This type of filter is implemented at the transport layer as a transparent proxy, or at the application layer as a web proxy.
[15] Filtering software may include data loss prevention functionality to filter outbound as well as inbound information. 
All users are subject to the access policy defined by the institution. The filtering can be customized, 
so a school district's high school library can have a different filtering profile than the district's junior high school library.


DNS-based filtering
This type of filtering is implemented at the DNS layer and attempts to prevent lookups for domains that do not 
fit within a set of policies (either parental control or company rules). Multiple free public DNS services offer 
filtering options as part of their services. DNS Sinkholes such as Pi-Hole can be also be used for this purpose, though client-side only.


Search-engine filters
Many search engines, such as Google and Bing offer users the option of turning on a safety filter. 
When this safety filter is activated, it filters out the inappropriate links from all of the search results. 
If users know the actual URL of a website that features explicit or adult content, they have the ability to access 
that content without using a search engine. Some providers offer child-oriented versions of their engines that permit 
only children friendly websites.[16]
